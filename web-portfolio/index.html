        <h3> Hello, I'm Jesse Speicher! </h3>
          <p> I'm a screen printer currently in Amarillo, Texas </p>
            <p> I've always worked in customer service so I know how to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Interact well with customers </li>
              <li> Fulfill the customers needs and get the job done correctly </li>
              <li> Work exceptionally well with my co-workers</li>
            </ul>
          <p> I would love it if you would interact with my website and contact me with any questions</p>

        <h2> About Me </h2>
          <p> I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design in 2016. I've always been interested in creating things, not just for myself, but more so for others. The feeling I get when I make a customers vision a reality is all worth the hardwork that goes into making the product. I'm a computer nerd at heart and have always wanted to further my knowledge with them. After starting with Thinkful I've been bettering myself in this field more than I thought possible.</p>
